# CISC3140-Lab-2
Lab is to use Linux terminal to create and update an SVN repository. Part 2 uses the terminal to download a .csv file from the Internet (using only the terminal) and generate a custom report via use of .awk script

Full Lab Description below
===============================================================

Lab 2 Overview: You will be completing several operations using the terminal interface and submitting a report that shows completed activities.

This is an individual lab, meaning each person should complete this on their own. You may converse with classmates as you complete it, however each individual should prepare their own submission.

Task 1 - Planning Exercise

This is a planning exercise to encourage thinking through requirements and time estimations before diving into technical tasks. 

Task Objective: 
Prepare a brief description that shows an estimate of how much time it will take to complete tasks that are outlined in this document and how you might schedule the time to work on various tasks. Note down additional detail, such as any tasks that have additional subtasks that are not mentioned or your OS specific considerations for tooling selection. You will be referring back to this description after completing tasks 2 and 3 in order to complete task 4. 

Requirements:
Submit either a plain text (.txt) or PDF (.pdf) file format
Include description of your OS and software tools that youâ€™ll use to complete the entire lab with annotations of what each software tool is used for.

Task 2 - SVN practice

Task Objective: 
Show the process for working with SVN repository from the terminal. After the stamps are completed you would have a terminal history of several commands that can be shared as a plain text file. 

Steps:
Create a new SVN repository
Create a file. Add this file to be tracked by the repository
Modify the file (to create a versioning diff), then commit the changes.
View the history of commits

Requirements:
The log should be a plain text file.
Sensible name for the log file, i.e. session.log.



Task 3 - Basic Data analysis

Task objective: 
Produce a makefile or shell script that can easily reproduce the same workflow for completing the data analysis task. 

Step:
Find a data file in a structured format (i.e. CSV), and download a copy of that data file to your working directory. 
Using only the program(s) available through the terminal interface, create a simple report. 
For example, if you are using the MovieLens dataset, you might be interested in showing the yearly count of movies per genre. 
There are many command options available, the task requires choosing a workable combination of commands to complete it. 
Prepare a makefile or script that reproduces the workflow of the above two steps.

Requirements:
Use programs available through the terminal
